Rather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service(8)
utility, e.g. service xinetd restart

Since the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an
Upstart job, you may also use the stop(8) and then start(8) utilities,
e.g. stop xinetd ; start xinetd. The restart(8) utility is also available.
