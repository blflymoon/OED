Date: November 20th, 2012

So far making usb disk has been verfied on Ubuntu11.10. Here is the steps:

1.Install Ubuntu11.10 in USB disk;

2.Create /pxeinstall direcroty;

3. Download the Source code from github:
	git clone https://github.com/oedcloud/OED.git 

4.Install modules listed below:
	dnsmasq: 2.57-1ubuntu1, xinetd: 1.3.1-1, apache2: 2.2.20-1ubuntu1.2, puppet: 2.7.1-1ubuntu3.5,  celery:2.6.0a1
	1)Install dnsmasq: apt-get install dnsmasq
	2)Install xinetd: apt-get install xinetd
	3)Install apache2: apt-get install apache2
	4)Install puppet: apt-get install puppet,puppetmaster
	5)Install ntp: apt-get install ntp
	6)Install Celery: pip install Celery
			  
5. Configure the above modules as below:
	1)dnsmasq
		Edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf and refer to /pxeinstall/config/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.conf
	2)xinetd module
		Add log_listen and nc_listen to /etc/xinetd.d/ and refer to /pxeinstall/config/xinetd/xinetd.d/log_listen & nc_listen
	3)apache2 module
		Edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and refer to /pxeinstall/config/apache2/httpd.conf
	4)puppet module
		Edit /etc/puppet/auth.conf and refer to /pxeinstall/config/puppet/auth.conf
		Edit /etc/puppet/fileserver.conf and refer to /pxeinstall/config/puppet/fileserver.conf
	5)ntp module
		Edit /etc/ntp.conf and refer to /pxeinstall/config/ntp/ntp.conf
	6)celery module
		It is not very convenient to have Celery run manually all the time. After all, a server reboot wouldn¡¯t bring it up again. Therefore it is desirable to have Celery run as an automatically started as a daemon. You need to to do the following: 
		a.Firstly, get the following file:
			https://github.com/ask/celery/blob/master/contrib/generic-init.d/celeryd
			Copy it to the folder /etc/init.d/ and mark it executable. 
		b.Then, create a default configuration file /etc/default/celeryd(taken from the Celery documentation). You can refer to /pxeinstall/config/celery/celeryd
		c.Finally, you have to tell the system about the new init script:
			sudo update-rc.d celeryd defaults
